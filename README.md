# I2C_pulse_counter
ATTINY85 based I2C pulse counter

This Arduino sketch uses an ATTINY85 as a pulse counter for the weather project
It uses low current relative to the I2C master (ESP32) and gives the ability
to perform more detailed 'time -slice' based wind evaluations

active current might be ~100uA
